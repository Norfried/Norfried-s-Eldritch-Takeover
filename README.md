# Norfried-s-Eldritch-Takeover
  A mod which adds interdimensional invasions by eldritch monstrosities! The creatures won't appear on their own, they must be awakened through a special interaction within a structure called the Forbidden Sanctum (not yet added to the world).

   This mod is still a work in progress with little to offer at the moment, but the current vision is to create monsters that scale in difficulty with how powerful the player is. Depending on the player's advancements, items obtained, stats improved, and certain mods installed, the monsters health, attack damage, abilities, and other features will be adjusted accordingly with the goal of providing challenging but fair enemies for the player to fight regardless of their arsenal.

   Note: NET (Norfried's Eldritch Takeover) was made for the 2025 1.12.2 Coalition Mod Jam, incomplete, but functional as far as I know (do report any & every issue that is found with the mod). All features are exclusively obtainable in creative mode as of now, but they will eventually be obtainable in survival as well.

   Hope you enjoy the current features for this mod as is!
